Supplementary Deployment Notes for MEAN
Coding Dojo Burbank - December 2017 (Angular 5)

Setting up the git repository:

Go into the angular app directory
Delete the .git repo automatically created in the angular cli
Remove the line "/dist" from the .gitignore file to make sure the /dist directory gets sent up to your remote repository.
Go to the project root "cd .."
Create another .gitignore file in the project root and add “/node_modules”(always) and “.DS_Store”(Mac only) to the file.
git init, git add, as usual

If you happen to miss the above steps:

in ubuntu:
Go to the angular app directory
sudo npm install @angular/cli -g
if the terminal starts endlessly looping control+c will stop it. Run the command again and it should work
sudo npm install
sudo ng build
The dist directory should be created for you to use.

If installing the bcrypt module causes an error when running sudo npm install:
sudo chown -R ubuntu /home/ubuntu/.config
npm install
Note there is no ‘sudo’ here!


Setting up mongodb:

If you run sudo service mongod start, then it will create a service that will interfere with the pm2 mongod because they need the same port. EDIT: After changes to the platform, you do not need to create mongod through pm2 anymore. Simply following the directions on the platform and creating a mongod service will work fine!
To properly check if mongod is working, just run "sudo mongod" ONLY
If you get an error (you likely will):
If it seems like your mongodb instance is not running, run sudo service mongod status. If there are errors related to permissions over /data/db:
sudo mkdir /data
sudo mkdir /data/db
sudo chown -R ubuntu /data
sudo chown -R ubuntu /data/db (to allow the non-superuser pm2 mongod access to the directory)

To check pm2 processes to make sure they are good to go:
sudo pm2 status




To look at error messages of mongod or server.js:
sudo pm2 show <id of your mongod process, usually 1>
vim {{directory_referenced_in_output_log_directory}}

If you make any changes to local files in the node server:
sudo pm2 restart <id of your server process, usually 0>
sudo service nginx reload && sudo service nginx restart
